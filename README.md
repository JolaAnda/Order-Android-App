Order

The application 'Order' is a Management System which enables the user to select and order food via your own smartphone when sitting in a restaurant. First the customer scans the QR code inside the app which is placed on the table of the restaurant. The menu card of the  suitable restaurant will appear on your smartphone and you can start selecting dishes. When first time used the user needs to sign up and fill in the payment details. Before you finish your order you choose whether you want to pay with paypal or later cash. In addition the system offers the owner of the restaurant the possibility to connect with a business software to accept all orders of the customers. The kitchen knows what to cook for which table. The project is developed with a complete Backend and Frontend.
